Welcome to Dagrad's documentation!
=======================================
The **dagrad** Python library is built to provide researchers with an extensible, 
modular platform for developing and experimenting with continuous score-based structure learning methods, 
building upon the introduction of the `NOTEARS <https://github.com/xunzheng/notears>`_ framework for differentiable structure learning. 

The source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/Duntrain/dagrad>`_.
